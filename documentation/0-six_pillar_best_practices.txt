Operational Excellence
-----------------------
    Monitoring and Logging:

        - Enable CloudWatch Logs: Ensure that your EKS cluster and Lambda functions have CloudWatch logging enabled for monitoring and troubleshooting.
        - Prometheus and Grafana: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for Kubernetes monitoring.
        - AWS X-Ray: Enable AWS X-Ray to trace requests from API Gateway through your Lambda functions and other services.
    
    Automation:

        - Terraform State Management: Ensure your Terraform state is stored in a secure S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
        - CI/CD Pipelines: Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.

Security
-------------
    IAM Roles and Policies:

        - Use least privilege access for IAM roles and policies.
        - Rotate IAM credentials regularly and use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for secret management.
    
    Network Security:

        - VPC: Place your EKS cluster and other resources within a VPC. Use subnets, security groups, and NACLs to control traffic.

        - Security Groups: Define strict security group rules for your EKS nodes, MongoDB, and other resources.
        
    Data Protection:

        - Encryption: Ensure all data at rest and in transit is encrypted. Use KMS for key management.

Reliability
---------------------------
    High Availability:

        - Multiple AZs: Deploy EKS nodes across multiple availability zones for high availability.
        - Auto Scaling: Use EKS managed node groups with auto-scaling policies to handle varying loads.

    Backup and Restore:

        - Snapshots: Regularly back up MongoDB data using snapshots.
        - Disaster Recovery: Implement a disaster recovery plan with defined RTO and RPO.

Performance Efficiency
-------------------------------
    Right-Sizing:

        - Regularly monitor and adjust the instance types and sizes of your EKS nodes and other resources.
        - Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to identify underutilized resources.

    Cost Optimization:

        - Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads to reduce costs.
        - Enable Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for long-term workloads.

Cost Optimization
-----------------------------
    Resource Management:

        - Use tags to categorize and track AWS resources for cost allocation.
        - Implement cost management tools like AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets.

    Storage Optimization:

        - Use lifecycle policies to transition old data to cheaper storage classes in S3.
        - Optimize EBS volumes by choosing appropriate volume types.

Sustainability
-------------------------------
    Optimize Resource Utilization:

        - Use efficient instance types and sizes to reduce energy consumption.
        - Optimize your Lambda function code to minimize execution time and memory usage.

    Leverage AWS Sustainability Programs:

        - Take advantage of AWSâ€™s carbon footprint tools to measure and reduce your environmental impact.
