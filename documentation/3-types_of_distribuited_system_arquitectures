Types of Distributed Systems and Architectures
Types of Distributed Systems

Client-Server Systems:
----------------------------------
Description: Clients request services and resources from servers which process and provide responses.
Example: Web applications where the browser is the client and the web server is the server.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems:
-----------------------------------
Description: All nodes have equal responsibilities and capabilities, and they share resources directly with each other.
Example: File-sharing networks like BitTorrent.

Three-Tier Architectures:
-----------------------------------
Description: Divides the system into three layers: Presentation (UI), Business Logic, and Data Storage.
Example: Web applications with front-end, application server, and database server.

N-Tier Architectures:
------------------------------------
Description: Extends three-tier architecture into more layers for better separation of concerns.
Example: Enterprise applications with additional layers for services, APIs, etc.

Microservices Architecture:
------------------------------------
Description: Breaks down applications into small, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Example: Modern cloud-native applications using containers and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):
----------------------------------------
Description: Similar to microservices but usually involves larger, more monolithic services that communicate over a network.
Example: Enterprise systems where different business functions are encapsulated as services.

Event-Driven Architecture:
------------------------------------------
Description: Uses events to trigger communication between decoupled services or components.
Example: Real-time applications like stock trading platforms.

Distributed Databases:
---------------------------------------------
Description: Database is spread across multiple nodes to improve availability and scalability.
Example: NoSQL databases like Cassandra or MongoDB.

Grid Computing:
----------------------------------------------
Description: Combines resources from multiple systems to work on a single task, often used for scientific computations.
Example: SETI@home project.

Fog and Edge Computing:
----------------------------------------------
Description: Extends cloud computing closer to the source of data generation (edge devices) to reduce latency.
Example: IoT applications.
